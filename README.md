# tinycommander
Shell script for the minimalistic busybox shell (ash) to approximate a file manager (similar to midnight or norton commander).

The Almquist shell is a rudimentary but complete tiny linux shell which is used as "standard shell" in Busybox or Tinycore Linux.
To simplify the work with command line based linux systems a file commander or explorer is very helpful.
Tinycommander uses a simple shell script to provide a piece of software without anything else is needed but a shell (i.e. no libraries).
In addition to the file manager tinycommander provides some tools like a scientific RPN-calculator or a simple presentation program.
